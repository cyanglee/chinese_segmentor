# Enable decoding of spammer's whitespace tricks ('f r e e' and

# Erase HTML comments.  Spammers hide bad words with HTML comments.
# For example: Mort<!--random-->gage. Default is 1 (on).

# Simply parse HTML (s/<[^>]*>//g).  The game here is to get rid of
# bogus tags spammers sometimes use to hide bad words.  For example:
# 'Via<BOGUS>gara'. Default is 1 (on).

# Fully parse HTML.  This is slower than the simple option.  It makes
# tune run about 2x slower on my corpus.  Also, this requires that you
# have HTML::TreeBuilder and its attendant modules installed.  If
# HTML::TreeBuilder cannot be found, the scripts will silently revert
# to simple html parsing as described above.
#
# With full parsing, tokenizing is more accurate, and it keeps track of
# background and font colors so that invisible text is discarded.
# Also this option can help defeat spammers' "slice and dice"
# technique (a big table with chunks of text in each cell).
# Fortunately, this technique is rare (as of this writing).  Default
# is 0 (off).

# Lowercase all text.  If your corpora are big enough (>1000 messages)
# you might consider turning this off.  Default is 1 (on).

# Number of times a token can be counted in an incoming spam.  Default

# If turned on, quiet-headers means that the only header bspam will
